# NLP to SQL Query Generator üêò

This project uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API to generate SQL queries based on natural language questions. It employs Streamlit for the user interface, making it easy to input questions and get SQL queries as responses.

Here‚Äôs the consolidated list of features, combining the existing ones with the new suggestions:

## Features

- **Converts natural language questions into SQL queries.**
  
- **Ensures the generated SQL queries adhere to predefined guidelines, including**:
  - Only using allowed commands (`SELECT`).
  - Only using allowed tables and columns.
  - Not using table aliases.

- **Provides explanations for the generated SQL queries.**

- **Validates the structure and content of SQL queries**:
  - Checks for allowed commands (`SELECT`, etc.).
  - Validates that only allowed tables and columns are used.
  - Validates country codes in the queries.

- **Additional Features**:
  1. **Subquery Support**:
     - Handles and validates subqueries, ensuring that tables, columns, and commands in nested queries adhere to the rules.
     
  2. **Join Clause Validation**:
     - Validates the usage of `JOIN` clauses to ensure that only allowed tables and columns are involved.

  3. **SQL Injection Prevention**:
     - Detects and sanitizes user inputs to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  
  4. **Regex and Pattern Matching Validation**:
     - Validates the usage of `REGEXP` or `LIKE` patterns within the query.

  5. **Aggregate Function Validation**:
     - Ensures the correct and allowed usage of aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc., on allowed columns.

  6. **HAVING Clause Support**:
     - Validates the usage of the `HAVING` clause, ensuring only allowed columns and aggregate functions are used.

  7. **Limit/Offset Validation**:
     - Checks the use of `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` to ensure they adhere to predefined thresholds for row-fetching limits.

  8. **SQL Error Reporting**:
     - Provides detailed error messages for invalid SQL queries, specifying which rule was violated (e.g., disallowed column/table).



## Installation

To get started, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can use a virtual environment or install the dependencies globally.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-to-sql-generator.git
cd nlp-to-sql-generator
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

#### For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install the Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have your OpenAI API key ready. You will need to add it to your Streamlit secrets.

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Open the provided local URL in your web browser.

4. Enter your natural language question into the input field and receive the generated SQL query.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- OpenAI API
- sql-metadata
- dateutil

All required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Adding Your OpenAI API Key

To securely add your OpenAI API key, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.streamlit` directory in the root of your project if it doesn't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.streamlit
```

2. Create a `secrets.toml` file in the `.streamlit` directory:

```bash
touch ~/.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `secrets.toml` file:

```toml
[openai]
api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
```
